This is  an example of reactstrap !

It is very simple and no doubt will greatly affend your sense of style!

I create a table and populate it with 2 cards.

The table is scrollable

The first / top card has an image.  So does the 2nd card.

Both cards have editor buttons.  The editor buttons pop open a fake editor.

Install and Run

npm install

npm start
